![Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aidan](img.svg)  
I'm a computer science student at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. A junior front-end developer at FMG Suite. A full-stack web developer for Platteville Web Solutions. The owner of DevAidan LLC, which is a business set up to take over the operations of Platteville Web Solutions. And I moonlight as an InfoSec researcher for cybernews.com. I don't know what path I want to take yet, am I a business owner, a cyber-security analyst, a developer? Only time will tell!
